# Influence of data characteristics to ML Model Performance and SHAP Explanations

This repository contains code used to investigate the effects of different data sizes and data imbalance on model performance and SHAP explanations in machine learning (ML) models. All the experiments carriedout with Type 2 diabetes dataset.

## Content

- `data/`: Contains dataset used in the study. This folder is currently empty due to privacy agreements regarding data usage.
- `src/`: Includes code for training, evaluating and analyzing model performance and SHAP explanations ML models.
- `figures/`: Contains output files and figures generated during the analysis.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/anushaihalapathirana/data_characteristics_shap_and_model_performance.git
``````
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies using 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Data Preparation**: Ensure dataset files are in the `data/` directory.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Run `__init__.py` scripts in the `src/` directory to train and evaluate ML models.
6. **Review Results**: Explore output files and figures in the `figures/` directory.
